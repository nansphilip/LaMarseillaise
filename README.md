# LaMarseillaise

Welcome to this project.

LaMarseillaise is a little project I've created to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. There is an auto-fit background image of *Les Calanques de Marseille* and the local weather report fetched from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)'s API.

You can see the result there : [LaMarseillaise](https://glittering-sawine-6bc396.netlify.app/).

See you later.
