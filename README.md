# LaMarseillaise

Welcome to this project.

La Marseillaise is a little project I've created to learn HTML, CSS and JS. There is and auto-fit background image of *Les Calanques de Marseille* and the local weather report fetched form [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)'s API.

Whatch the result here : [LaMarseillaise](https://glittering-sawine-6bc396.netlify.app/).
